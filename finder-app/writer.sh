# Write a shell script finder-app/writer.sh as described below
# * Accepts the following arguments:
#	the first argument is a full path to a file (including
# 	filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as 'writefile';
#	the second argument is a text string which will be written
#	within this file, referred to below as 'writestr'
#
# * Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the
#   arguments above were not specified
#
# * Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content
#   'writestr', overwriting any existing file and creating the path
#   if it doesnâ€™t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement
#   if the file could not be created.
#
# Example:
#       writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios
#
# Creates file:
#    /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt
#            With content:
#            ios
